# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### *Dev notes:* 

I decided to go with a simple app with the classic Create React app Generator. 
I also added [Tailwind.CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling as I find the conventions offered by that library to be very useful and easy to read/maintain.
